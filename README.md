# Table Top Tanks
## Description
Originally, this was just an implementation of a physics engine, attempting to copy the physics and controls from the Wii Play tanks game for my Computer Science A-Level Non-Exam Assessment (NEA), done between 2019 and 2021.

After my NEA and A-Level were complete, however, I decided I wanted to continue the developments of this in my year off, and so I began adding features. The first, was to change this into a PvP game, where you have to attempt to destroy the other tanks, followed by procedural generation of arenas, and power ups as well.

Included in this repo is some footage and images of it in actions.

N.B. this was my first Unity/C# project, started at 16, so please forgive the coding style.
